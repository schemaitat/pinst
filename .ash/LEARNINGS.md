# Distilled learnings

Lessons that generalize beyond the plan that produced them. Read this before
planning new work. Written by the `plan-learn` skill; append-only, with its own
`LESSON-NNN` sequence independent of any plan's `ISSUE-NNN` numbering.

### LESSON-001: A skill that is not projected into the runtime's own directory never loads
**Lesson:** After adding or renaming anything under `.agents/skills/`, run
`just wire`, and let `just harness` verify it. Treat "the file exists in the
repo" as saying nothing about whether an agent can actually load it.
**Why:** `.agents/` is a vendor-neutral convention, not a path any runtime
reads — Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/`. An unwired skill fails silently:
there is no error, the skill simply never appears, and the nearest thing that
*does* load is whatever stale copy exists in someone's personal `~/.claude`.
Silence is the whole problem, which is why the check has to be mechanical.
**Seen in:** the harness audit on `feat/agents-orchestration` — all four repo
skills were unwired, and a drifted personal copy of `plan-write` was loading
in their place.

### LESSON-002: An invariant that lives only in prose has already drifted
**Lesson:** When a convention is worth writing into a skill, write the check
that enforces it in the same change, and wire the check into `just qc`.
**Why:** Skills are instructions to a model that may or may not be in context
when the relevant edit happens, and they say nothing at all about the
documents written before the convention existed. Every invariant the plan
skills stated in prose — quoted indices, no duplicate `## Status` section,
a regenerated `INDEX.md` — was being violated by the corpus at the moment the
skills were committed. An exit code is checkable by anyone, at any time,
without having read the skill.
**Seen in:** the harness audit on `feat/agents-orchestration` (both legacy
plans predated the format their own skills mandate).
